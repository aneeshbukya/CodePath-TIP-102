# Print Players Linked List
### 1. U-nderstand
# HAPPY CASE:
# Input: A linked list with nodes isabelle -> saharah -> cj
# Output: "Isabelle -> Saharah -> C.J."
# Explanation: The node values are concatenated with the separator "->".
# EDGE CASE:
# Input: An empty linked list (None).
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Since there are no nodes, the result is an empty string.
# Key Questions:
# How should the function handle an empty linked list?
# Return an empty string.
# Is there any specific constraint on the list length or values?
# There are no explicit time/space constraints mentioned, but the function should handle traversal efficiently.
# 2. M-atch
# Problem Type: Linked List
# Pattern/Strategy:
# Traversing the List: We'll iterate through each node until the end is reached.
# Collecting Values: We'll store each nodeâ€™s value in a list.
# String Manipulation: We'll concatenate these values using the "->" separator.
#### 3. P-lan
# Steps:
# Initialize an empty list to hold the values of each node.
# Set the current node to the head of the linked list.
# Loop through the nodes while the current node is not None:
# Add the value of the current node to the list.
# Move to the next node.
# Join the values with the separator "->".
# Return the resulting string.

        current = current.next  # Move to the next node
    return " -> ".join(values)  # Join the values with '->' separator

# Example Usage:

#  Chase String
### U - Understand
# Share 2 questions you would ask to help understand the question:
# How should the function behave if the linked list is empty? Should it return an empty string?
# Should there be an extra separator ("chases") at the end of the string, or should it stop after the last node?
# P - Plan
# Write out in plain English what you want to do:
# Traverse the linked list, starting from the head, and collect the values of each node. Concatenate these values with the word "chases" as a separator and return the resulting string. If the list is empty, return an empty string.
# Translate each sub-problem into pseudocode:
# Initialize an empty list to store the values of the nodes.
# Set the current node to the head of the linked list.
# While the current node is not None:
# Append the value of the current node to the list.
# Move to the next node.
# Join the node values with the string " chases " and return the result.
# If the head is None, return an empty string.
